# first2frist

first2frist is a very simple Firefox extension that replaces the word "first" with the word "frist" on all webpages. This is based on a meme from [worsethanfailure.com](https://worsethanfailure.com/).

See how to [install the extension](https://daniel-ostrowski.github.io/video/frist-demo.webm). The extension is not signed by Mozilla so it needs to be reinstalled if Firefox is restarted.
